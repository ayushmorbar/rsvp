# RSVP by Offbeats - MVP Executive Summary

**Project:** RSVP by Offbeats  
**Date:** September 8, 2025  
**Team:** Product Management & UX Research  
**Status:** MVP Definition Phase

## Vision Statement
Create a user-centric platform that democratizes event discovery and management, **starting with the underserved student market** as our beachhead before expanding to serve all communities seeking unique, authentic experiences.

## Strategic Approach
**Phase 1: Student Market Domination (Months 1-12)**
- Deep penetration in university and college markets
- Campus-specific features and partnerships
- Student organization focus with budget-friendly solutions

**Phase 2: General Market Expansion (Year 2+)**
- Scale successful student features to broader community events
- Corporate and professional event management
- Global expansion with localized community features

## Problem Statement
Current event platforms (Eventbrite, Meetup) impose high fees, complex workflows, and poor mobile experiences that particularly hurt student organizations with limited budgets. Students struggle to discover relevant local events beyond social media, while student organizers face barriers to promotion, attendee management, and affordable solutions that don't eat into their already tight budgets.

## Value Proposition
**For Student Attendees:** Discover campus and local events that match your interests, with peer trust signals, one-tap RSVP, and features designed for the student lifestyle and budget.

**For Student Organizers:** Launch events quickly with zero platform fees for student organizations, intuitive mobile-first tools, campus-specific features, and analytics that help build thriving student communities.

**Future General Market:** Proven simplicity and community features scaled to serve professional organizers, corporate events, and broader community gatherings.
