## Executive Summary

### Strategic Vision & Market Approach
**"Start with students, scale to everyone - democratizing event discovery with the simplicity and affordability that student communities deserve."**

**Phase 1 Strategy: Student Market Beachhead**
RSVP by Offbeats begins by solving the most acute pain points in the student event ecosystem - high platform fees, discovery friction, and poor mobile experiences that particularly impact budget-conscious student organizations.

**Phase 2 Strategy: General Market Expansion**
Once we achieve market leadership in the student space, we'll leverage our proven platform, community features, and operational excellence to serve the broader event management market.

RSVP by Offbeats addresses critical pain points in the student event ecosystem:
- **For Attendees:** Eliminate discovery friction and repetitive form filling
- **For Organizers:** Reduce platform fees and complexity while increasing reach

### Core Differentiators (Student-First Approach)
1. **Zero fees for student organizations** (vs. Eventbrite's 2.9% + $0.99 per ticket)
2. **Campus-native design** with edu-email verification and campus-specific features
3. **Mobile-first student experience** with smart auto-fill reducing RSVP friction by 60%
4. **Student lifestyle optimization** - PWA with offline ticket access for spotty campus WiFi
5. **Peer trust signals** through campus verification and student community reviews
6. **Scalable foundation** designed to expand to general market once student PMF is proven

### MVP Success Criteria
- **30+ active organizers** with 2+ events each in first 60 days
- **8%+ discovery-to-RSVP** conversion rate
- **85%+ RSVP completion** rate with smart auto-fill
- **40%+ repeat RSVP** rate within 30 days
- **>70 SUS score** for user experience

**Top Pain Points Identified:**
1. **High platform fees** (78% of student org discussions mention cost barriers)
2. **Discovery friction** (65% struggle with event promotion beyond social media)
3. **Repetitive data entry** (causes 35% RSVP abandonment)
4. **Poor mobile experience** (89% of interactions happen on mobile)
5. **Lack of peer trust signals** (peer recommendations 3x more influential)

### Primary Personas

#### Clara the Club President (Organizer)

### Competitive Analysis
| Platform | Our Advantage |
|----------|---------------|
| **Eventbrite** | 60% lower fees, mobile-first UX, campus features |
| **Meetup** | Event-based pricing vs. subscription, modern design |
| **Lu.ma** | Payment processing, campus verification, comprehensive features |
| **Luma** | Open platform vs. invite-only, proven scalability |
